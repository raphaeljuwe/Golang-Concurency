# Golang-Concurency

## Golang-mini-ecommerce implementing Concurrency

Concurrency is when a large task is split into smaller sub-tasks and run at the same time

Waitgroups allow waiting for goroutines. So, when multiple goroutines are being executed it will allow it to wait for each of them to finish.

GoLang Waitgroups are important because they allow a goroutine to block the thread and execute it. Without it, we need to manually sleep the main thread to let the goroutines execute.
